Power BI Projects
Welcome to my Power BI projects repository! Here, you'll find various dashboards and reports that I've created using Power BI to analyze and visualize data.

Contents
Sales Dashboard
This dashboard provides an overview of our company's sales data, with slicers for year, month, customer city, product, and category, allowing for easy customization and analysis of the data. The dashboard includes various visualizations, including sales, budget, and profit data, as well as sales by customers, profit by products, and sales by city.

Customer Overview
This overview provides insights into specific customer data, with visualizations for sales, profit, and other key metrics for individual customers.

Product Overview
This overview provides insights into specific product data, with visualizations for sales, profit, and other key metrics for individual products.

Usage
To use these dashboards, simply open the Power BI file in Power BI Desktop, connect to your data source, and refresh the data. You can then interact with the visualizations and slicers to analyze your own data.
